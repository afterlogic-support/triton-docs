Groups
------

Groups allows you to bring things together simplifying further management.

The group is a quite simple object, it consist of two fields: name and scope.
Name is for identifying and scope is for defining what kind of objects may be putted into a given group.

You can filter main lists by group.

.. note:: Each group has it's scope,for example: you can not put templates and triggers into same group.
