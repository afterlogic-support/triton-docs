On the Settings page you may set some params:

- License key.
- Pagination settings.
- Default recipient settings.

The last one is the most tricky here.
It allows you to set email and user_id that will be used as default values on testing form.
Of course you may change it right before the test, but it is very useful when you have a special email address for testing purposes.

.. note:: Settings are stored in user's context. It means custom values for each user.
